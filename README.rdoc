= RailsAdmin
==== RailsAdmin is a Rails engine that provides an easy-to-use interface for managing your data
RailsAdmin was conceived as a port of MerbAdmin[http://github.com/sferik/merb-admin] to Rails 3 and implemented as a {Ruby Summer of Code project}[http://www.rubysoc.org/projects] by {Bogdan Gaza}[http://github.com/hurrycane] with mentors {Erik Michaels-Ober}[http://github.com/sferik], {Yehuda Katz}[http://github.com/wycats], {Rodrigo Rosenfeld Rosas}[http://github.com/rosenfeld], {Luke van der Hoeven}[http://github.com/plukevdh], and {Rein Henrichs}[http://github.com/reinh].

It currently offers the following functionality:
* Show database tables
* Easily update data
* Create new data
* Safely delete data
* Automatic form validation
* Search
* Authentication (via Devise[http://github.com/plataformatec/devise])
* User action history

== Installation
In your <tt>Gemfile</tt>, add the following dependency:
  gem 'devise' # Devise must be required before RailsAdmin
  gem 'rails_admin', :git => 'git://github.com/sferik/rails_admin.git'
Run:
  $ bundle update
And then run:
  $ rails generate rails_admin:install_admin
This task will install RailsAdmin. During this process, it install Devise[http://github.com/plataformatec/devise] if you don't already have it installed. Devise[http://github.com/plataformatec/devise] is required for authentication to protect your data from anonymous users.

== Usage
Start the server:
  $ rails server
You should now be able to administer your site at http://localhost:3000/admin (after you have created a simple account)
